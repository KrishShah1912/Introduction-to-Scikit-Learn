# Introduction-to-Scikit-Learn
This repository documents my hands-on exploration of Scikit-learn, developed as part of my academic and self-learning journey in machine learning. It includes curated examples, experiments, and insights aimed at strengthening foundational understanding.

ðŸ“š What's Inside
Data preprocessing techniques using Scikit-learn's pipelines
Classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, k-NN
Regression models with visualization and error analysis
Unsupervised learning: K-Means, DBSCAN clustering
Performance metrics: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, and F1 score
Cross-validation and basic hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
Develop familiarity with Scikit-learnâ€™s intuitive API structure
Apply machine learning models to real-world datasets
Interpret model outputs and improve results iteratively
Build a foundation for more advanced ML frameworks like TensorFlow

ðŸ§ª Format & Tools
Python-based implementations in Jupyter Notebooks
Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
Datasets sourced from Scikit-learn or external repositories
